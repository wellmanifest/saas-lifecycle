## Implementation scope

This ticket adds `.github/workflows/planfile-github-sync.yml` using the reusable workflow published by
`semcod/planfile` at `v0.1.126`. It runs on the repository schedule, on
Planfile changes, and through manual dispatch. The workflow has only read access
to repository contents and write access to GitHub Issues.

## Session authorization

The user request to update the other projects and make synchronization automatic
records `SESSION_EXECUTION_AUTHORIZATION` for this bounded implementation.
